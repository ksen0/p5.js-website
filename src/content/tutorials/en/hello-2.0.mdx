Welcome to p5.js 2.0! This tutorial is a step by step guide of how to update your existing code to work with the new major version, released in 2025. If you're just getting started with p5.js for the first time, you can skip this, and go directly to:

* <a href=> Get Started</a>

# Updating p5.js 1.x code to use p5.js 2.x

Most things are the same between p5.js 1.x and 2.0, but there are some big differences: p5.js 2.0 has new capabilities, and it also no longer supports some aspects of p5.js 1.x.

All the running code examples in this tutorial will use 2.0, with the 1.x code in the comments. If you'd like to go through the code side by side, you can also check this <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js-compatibility">read-me</a> for the compatibility add-ons.
